								<p>
									Data science is a complex subject, but nevertheless one that can be made accessible to all through clear,
									intuitive explanations and worked examples.
								</p>

								<p>
									Existing software that forms the backbone of an immunologist's analytical toolkit (such as FlowJo and Prism) are expensive,
									inflexible and promotes a narrow mindset when it comes to analysing your data. On the other hand, the Python and R programming
									languages are open source, free and entirely customisable, giving the user the ability to implement any analysis they wish.
								</p>
								<p>
									Although programming languages can seem daunting to the uninitiated, it's far easier to learn than many immunologists may think.
									Rather than seeking to become an expert programmer, an understanding of the main concepts is more than enough to conduct your
									own bespoke analyses when coupled with a sound mathematical and statistical understanding.
								</p>
								<p>
									â€‹Our book focusses on the practical aspects of data science, providing sufficient theoretical background without delving into
									all of the details of each of the methods presented. Introductory chapters are presented alongside the analysis of a publicly
									available data set, allowing the reader to have practical hands-on experience when learning about important concepts in statistics,
									machine learning and programming. Topics include: -
									
									<ul>
										<li>How to build a predictive model</li>
										<li>How to visualise high-dimensional data</li>
										<li>Basics of programming in Python and R</li>
										<li>What techniques exist to cluster data</li>
										<li>Which statistics test to use/why/when</li>
										<li>What is dimension reduction; when and how to use it</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Once these fundamental topics have been covered, a number of case studies are presented, along with the underlying data, accompanying
									code and full explanations on topics such as automated, data-driven flow cytometry, building predictive models of disease using gene
									expression profiling and analysing high throughput sequencing data.

										<h4>Niclas Thomas</h4>
										<p>MMath MRes PhD</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Niclas is a professional data scientist with experience at several large retailers,
										tackling a wide range of business problems using advanced mathematical and statistical techniques.
									</p>
									<p>
										He gained a PhD at UCL using machine learning to build predictive models of the immune system,
										combining standard experimental techniques with advanced analytical methods. These methods were
										applied to a variety of data types, from high throughput sequencing data to lower dimensional cell
										frequency data. Following completion of his PhD, he worked as a post-doctoral research associate,
										using machine learning to predict renal transplant failure from flow cytometry data.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whilst academic data science differs to corporate data science on a couple of points, such as scope
										for innovation and pace of delivery, there are far more similarities than differences. Both require
										sound theoretical knowledge, the ability to programmatically implement mathematical ideas, a collaborative
										mindset and the ability to communicate complex approaches and results to non-technical colleagues.
										The last of these points is a real passion of his.
									</p>
									<p>
										He consults on several immunological projects, advising on statistical analysis, experimental design
										and visualisation techniques amongst other things. As well as improving the quality of data analysis,
										he enjoys bringing data science to new audiences, and this website and associated book is written with
										this in mind.

										<h4>Laura Pallett</h4>
										<p>BSc PhD</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Laura is a postdoctoral research scientist at UCL, focussing on understanding the mechanisms of immune
										dysfunction in chronic hepatitis B infection. Having gained a PhD in viral immunology with first-author
										publications in Nature Medicine and Journal of Experimental Medicine, she is now investigating immunological
										mechanisms at play in the human liver, with specific interests in immunometabolism and tissue-residency.
									</p>
									<p>
										Whilst having trained as a laboratory scientist, she has recently taken a keen interest in advanced in silico
										techniques for the analysis of immunological data. In particular, she believes that strong fundamentals in
										statistics coupled with practical knowledge of visualisation techniques is a must for the modern immunologist.
									</p>
									<p>

										In addition to her academic experience, she has worked at GlaxoSmithKline and acts on immunology advisory
										boards for Gilead.
									</p>
									<p>
										She is passionate about science communication, and is the co-founder and co-author of her lab's twitter feed,
										with the aim of bringing their work to a broader audience. She is also an early careers representative on the
										British Society of Immunology Forum.
